PROPERTY
Type of building to inspect
House:
Condominium

Information
The inspection of a building divided in co-ownership consists in doing the inspection of the systems and the components
EXCLUSIVELY inside the unit the client wants to acquire. Therefore, for any CO-OWNED buildings type, COMMON AREAS
ARE NOT INSPECTED. This inspection will then be limited as follow:
- Horizontally: The finished surfaces of all inside walls of the unit;
- Vertically: From the finished surface of the ceiling to the finished floor of the unit.
INFORMATION: Any section of this report related to common areas (parts excluded from the actual mandate) will remain
blank on purpose. If for any reason a picture or an information would appear, it would solely be to INFORM you.
TAKE NOTE: Our inspection mandate of a residential building in divided co-ownership, COULD include the systems and the
components belonging to the common areas of the building, only under the care, the guarding and the control of the syndicate
of co-owners. Furthermore, a written authorization must be supplied by this one. When such an inspection is requested, the
fees related to our professional services will apply. Ask for an estimate prior to the inspection and we will be pleased to help
you with such a request.

To be corrected
CAUTION!! We noticed that the safety reversing system was defective, out of adjustment and/or missing. Risks of serious
injuries are possible to all users. It is strongly suggested to condemn access IMMEDIATELY until the necessary corrective
measures are taken. Call a specialized and qualified technician if necessary.

Garage floor
Floor covering:
Concrete

Observation:
Cracked

Recommendation
FURTHER INFORMATION REQUIRED FROM THE SYNDICATE:
During the inspection, it was observed that the garage floor exhibited several cracks. To address this issue, it is recommended
to consult with the condominium syndicate to determine whether an evaluation has been conducted to identify the cause of
these cracks. Additionally, inquire if any necessary tests have been performed to assess the severity of the issue. Buyers
should ensure they have a clear understanding of the situation and any potential repairs or maintenance required before
finalizing the property purchase.

Obligations / Recommendations: IMPORTANT - There must be no links between the garage and the living
space (ex: ventilation, and/or any opening cracks, holes, central vacuums, etc.) from which could leak carbon
monoxide inside the living space. Furthermore, the door leading to the building from the garage must be solid
without windows (except if armed), weather stripped, and equipped with an automatic door closing device in order
to create an airtight seal. Immediately correct any deficiencies for the safety of all users and occupants.
In order to protect and preserve the structural integrity and the building components, it is IMPERATIVE to
maintain the temperature in a minimum of 5 degrees Celsius if the garage is independent from the building, and
minimally at 17 degrees Celsius if it is adjacent to it.

DOORS AND WINDOWS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CONDO UNIT
General note
Recommendation: Regular maintenance of door and window components prolongs their lifespan. Thoroughly
lubricate the mechanisms but also the weather-strips around the edges with the appropriate products, on a
regular basis, according to the manufacturer's recommendations.
A bedroom window must also serve as an emergency exit. So, if the building is not protected by automatic fire
extinguishers, for the safety of the occupants, each bedroom must have an opening unobstructed of at least 0.35
m2 (3.77 ft2) with neither side less than 380 mm (15 in.). If its threshold (from the inside) is more than 1.5 m (5 pi)
from the finished floor, built-in furniture may be required to allow its access. If the window overlooks a skylight, a
minimum space of 760 mm (30 in) must be provided in front of the window to allow evacuation. This distance may
increase in the case of an awning window that opens to the outside. If this skylight is covered by an external
protective enclosure, the latter must open from the inside without a key, nor tools, nor special knowledge of the
opening mechanism.

Windows associated with the condo unit
Limitation: Weather conditions and / or limited access can be impediments to handling permanent doors and
windows. The inspector is not required to inspect the presence or condition of non-permanent screens, doors and
windows. It is not always possible for the inspector to operate each window, our assessment of the windows can
be made by sampling.
PVC or aluminum windows can last up to 25 years, a much longer period than the average lifespan of wooden
windows, which is only 15 years.
Information: It is strongly suggested to remove window screens during the winter season. If they are located
outside, they may be damaged by snow. If located inside, these create a thermal barrier preventing heat from
reaching the glass optimally. Increased condensation is therefore present on the glass and the frost which results
therefrom will attack the seal of the thermos pane and damage it more quickly.

Observation:

Aluminum

Mold / rot

Information
It is not uncommon for windows to be classified as common areas in condominium buildings. To clarify this information and
understand how it may impact your personal expenses in the event of a defect, consult with your real estate agent or the
seller. They should validate this information with the condominium syndicate, ensuring you are well informed about any
potential responsibilities related to window maintenance and repairs.

Inspected by Gohar Ali

Page 8/39

1410 Rue Hyman #302, Montréal Pierrefonds-Roxboro

To be corrected
During our inspection, we noticed windows that needs to be fixed or adjusted as they do not close airtight. We strongly suggest
that you get a professional to repair the affected window(s).

Recommendation
During our inspection, we observed signs of condensation in the windows (black stains / marks at the bottom of all windows).
We recommend that you monitor / manage your humidity level in the house and clean all windows to prevent mold from
forming and damaging the health of the occupants. If necessary, retain the services of a qualified contractor to assess the
various possible corrective measures for the ventilation of the building.

Doors associated with the condo unit
Observation:
Weatherstripping missing and/or damaged
Insufficient clearance
Misadjusted
Automatic closing mechanism

Confidential report prepared for the exclusive use of Karishmaben Patel
Inspected by Gohar Ali

Page 9/39

1410 Rue Hyman #302, Montréal Pierrefonds-Roxboro

Information
In many cases, doors are regarded as common areas within condominium buildings. To determine whether this applies to your
situation, consult with your real estate agent or the seller. They should verify this information with the condominium syndicate,
as it may influence your personal expenses if a defect is detected. Being informed about potential responsibilities related to
door maintenance and repairs is crucial for managing your expenses effectively.

Recommendation
During our inspection, we observed that some doors require installation adjustments and / or corrections. Make the necessary
corrections immediately.

To be corrected
During our inspection, we were able to observe that the automatic closing mechanism of the entrance door of the unit could
not fulfill its function, which is to close the door hermetically. An adjustment of the door will be necessary upon taking
possession to allow the mechanism to securely close the door.

To be corrected
During our inspection, we noted improper/damaged weatherstrip. It is crucial to air-seal the interior door between the common
hallway and living space to prevent smoke and carbon monoxide migration into the unit in case of a fire in the common area or
another unit. We strongly recommend correcting the weatherstrip to ensure the safety of the occupants. We strongly advise
carrying out the necessary corrections promptly.

Monitoring recommended
Clearance under the door's threshold is insufficient. A clearance of 6" is recommended under all doors. Risk of infiltration, rot
of the door frame and structure, correct immediately. Since this inspection is visual and not exhaustive, it is impossible for us
to validate if the current condition has already caused a history of infiltration and affected the underlying materials. Remove
and replace all damaged materials where required. Correct the situation and keep plowed at all times, caulk well.

OUTSIDE ACCESS
Porch / Terrace / Balcony
Balcony:

Observation:

Front
Other : Roof terrace

Balcony wood components exposed
Cracked slab / panel

Recommendation
NOTE FOR SYNDICATE:
During the inspection, we observed cracks in the concrete slab / finishing panel of the balcony. Seal all cracks, openings and /
or joints to prevent infiltration and the effect of freezing and thawing worsening and damaging the structure and integrity of the
elements.
Since this inspection is visual and not exhaustive, it is impossible for us to validate if the current condition has already caused
a history of infiltration and affected the underlying materials. Remove and replace all damaged materials where required.

Recommendation
During the inspection, it was observed that the wooden balcony exhibited a noticeable drop in the middle, which raises
concerns about the structural integrity and support. Additionally, the structure supporting the balcony was not visible, making it
difficult to assess its condition and stability.
To address this issue, it is recommended to consult with a qualified contractor to evaluate the balcony's structural integrity and
determine the cause of the drop. Necessary repairs or reinforcement should be carried out to ensure the safety and longevity
of the balcony. Buyers should address this concern before finalizing the property purchase.

Recommendation
All exterior wooden elements must be protected from the weather to prevent premature deterioration. Use a product / material
recommended by a specialist in any good hardware store. Replace and remove any damaged materials if necessary.

To be corrected
We noticed that certain elements of the balcony were rotten or damaged. Exposed wood requires regular maintenance to
avoid more important problems that may become more costly. Corrective action is immediately required to ensure the integrity
of the balcony and the building. Remove and replace all damaged components.

PLUMBING
Limitation
Limitation: Our focus in the plumbing portion of the inspection is directed at identifying visible water damage
and/or problems. We may not always mention common faults such as stuck stoppers or dripping faucets. If
considered important, you should check these items independently. Shut-off valves and angle stops under the
kitchen or bathroom sinks and toilets are not turned or tested during the inspection due to the possibility of
leaking. All shut-off valves or angle stops should be turned regularly to ensure free movement in case of
emergency. The water supply system was tested for its ability to deliver functional water flow to installed plumbing
fixtures and the condition of connected piping that was visible.

Material (indoor plumbing)
(potable water, indoor plumbing):
Copper

Interior plumbing / sewers:
ABS Plastic

Common areas not inspected
During our inspection, we found that all walls and ceilings in the unit are enclosed by fixed materials such as gypsum, and
visible conduits are primarily located over the water tank and/or under sinks. However, it's important to note that this was a
visual and non-exhaustive inspection, which means we may not have been able to identify all the pipes behind the walls. As
such, we cannot confidently acknowledge the type of pipes hidden in those areas.

Copper

Water flow:
Average

Near hot water tank

Recommendation
We recommend that you always shut off your main water valve whenever you leave for an extended period, including long
weekends or vacations. This practice can help prevent unexpected water damage upon your return. If your main water valve is
a "ball valve" type rather than a conventional faucet, it's essential to open it gradually to avoid causing a sudden pressure
surge in your plumbing system. A rapid increase in pressure could potentially break a union joint or weld, inadvertently leading
to the water damage you're trying to avoid. Adopting this habit can contribute to better home maintenance and protection.

Cleanouts
Observation:
Not visible

Limited inspection
We have observed that one or more cleanouts of the sewage system is not visible. The latter is used to allow cleaning and
inspection of the pipes when necessary. We recommend that you inquire as to their location with the owner-seller before the
expiration of the inspection condition of your promise to purchase.

Water heater

Page 14/39

1410 Rue Hyman #302, Montréal Pierrefonds-Roxboro
General comment: Life expectancy
The life expectancy of a water heater is very variable, since various factors are taken into account. First, the type
of water, and especially its mineral content, can cause accelerated aging of the reservoir. For example, water with
a high iron content can be abrasive and cause damages more quickly.
The manufacturing quality of your device can also have an impact on its life expectancy. The qualities and types
of water heaters vary widely, and in this sense, you should think about changing your water heater after 10 years,
or at least inspecting it regularly after this period. In addition, some insurers may decide not to cover devices that
are too old due to the increasing number of claims caused by water.
It is recommended to install the water heater on a basin so that the freshness of the slab does not come into
contact with the base of the water heater. (Energy saving and this reduces condensation and rust at the base of
the water heater). It is also recommended to drain the water heater once a year to remove deposits on its base.
For the safety of the occupants, it is recommended to adjust the thermostat to a minimum of 140F in order to
prevent the formation of bacteria in the appliance. (CMHC)
Note: for added protection, the basin must be connected to the floor drain or the sewer.
Ref. Building management Safety code and good practices in plumbing February 2012 Connection of a water
heater with PEX piping. The installation of copper piping is not a regulatory requirement but rather a
recommendation of the PEX pipe manufacturer. Connection to a water heater should be in accordance with the
manufacturer's instructions, usually using metal connectors at least 45 cm (18 ") in length. Consult a certified
plumber to verify and confirm that installation of the water heater is compliant and safe.

Plumbing limitations
Limitation / Recommendation: The inspector does not check systems hidden behind interior finishings, buried,
closed, or out of order, private or public supply and evacuation systems, water quality or water treatment, and
possible leaks from baths or showers. The inspector does not assess the capacity or adequacy of the systems or
the presence or absence of an emergency shutoff valve. The main water inlet valve and emergency valves on
appliances, washrooms and those under sinks and sinks are not handled because of the risk of leaks. No valve or
faucet for the appliances present will be checked during the inspection. The inspection of the plumbing is
therefore limited.
The washer's supply hoses are not disconnected during inspection and the faucets are not turned on. They can
leak at any time and should be part of regular maintenance. The washer and dryer are not moved during
inspection to prevent damages. A limited review of the area behind the washer and dryer is done.
The inspection of the kitchen is as visual as it is functional. Shutoff valves and angle stops located under the
kitchen or bathroom and toilet sinks are not opened or tested during the inspection due to the possibility of
leakage. The equipments are not switched on. No inspection will be done on the cooking systems and
dishwashers.
Not inspected or untested:
Hidden plumbing not inspected
Water treatment equipment not inspected
Domestic water pump not tested
Therapeutic whirlpool bath, sauna, spa not tested
Solid waste pump (garburator) untested
Isolation valve, safety valve and main water shutoff valve untested

Bathroom / powder room
Recommendation: It is imperative to maintain a seal in good condition around baths, showers, sinks, faucets
and toilets to prevent water infiltration that can cause damage to building components. Make the necessary
corrections where needed and make sure there is no previous water infiltration. In this case, remove and replace
any damaged materials.

Limitations
Limitation / Warning:
In order to open an electrical panel, it is imperative to shut-off the main electrical breaker. Due to potential risks at
restoring power, electrical panels are not opened. Our review of the electrical system is limited to what is visible
and accessible at the time of inspection. The inspection of the components of the electric system is limited. The
inspector shall record all conditions that, in his opinion, are substandard. The inspector shall examine the interior
of the electrical panel and distribution panels only if access to them is easy and not dangerous. A random
sampling of accessible light fixtures and wall sockets will be made. The component parts of the electric system
that are hidden behind furniture or other objects, enclosed within the structure and finishes of the building, or
buried underground will not be verified. We will not verify low-voltage systems, telephone wiring, intercoms, alarm
systems, television cables, house automation systems or outdoor electrical systems for pools and sheds.

If the customer wants a more detailed inspection, it is recommended to have the electrical network checked by a
master electrician to ensure that everything is in compliance with codes and standards before the final signing of
contracts.

CAUTION :

Information / Warning : Certain Schneider Electric Square D brand panel models from December 2019 and later
may be part of a manufacturer recall. The affected products may overheat and pose a fire hazard. We
recommend that you contact Schneider Electric Canada immediately to schedule an appointment to have their

HEATING / AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEMS
General statement:
Our general heating system inspection does not include checking the uniformity of the heating or the calibration of
a central heating system or its efficiency in general. It is only a verification that the equipment is working or not
during the inspection.

Please note that for central heating systems, a maintenance contract with a specialized company is
recommended to perform regular maintenance as recommended by the manufacturer and in case of breakdown.
It is only a verification that the equipment is working or not during the inspection.

***Adopted on November 17, 2021, the Oil-Fired Heating Equipment Regulation announces the end of the oil era
in the home. This regulation provides that, as of December 31, 2021, the installation of an oil-burning appliance is
prohibited in new residential construction. This includes boilers, furnaces and water heaters that use oil in whole
or in part. But the provincial government is going even further.

Maintenance of these appliances will be allowed as long as they are in good working order. However, as of
December 31, 2023, it will be prohibited, in an existing residential building, to proceed with a major repair of a
boiler, furnace operating in whole or in part with oil, or a replacement with another fossil fuel-fired heating
appliance. For a water heater of this type, the requirement takes effect after 10 years.

Obligation / Limitation: COMBUSTION EQUIPMENT: Any combustion appliance such as a power generator,
wood stove, gas, oil, etc. as well as their chimney and / or outlet, fuel tank and conduits and their required
clearance must be inspected/verified by a certified expert before use and before the expiration of the inspection
condition of your promise to purchase. An annual maintenance must be carried out thereafter.
Important! Obtain a valid certificate of conformity for your insurance.
LIMITATION: The heat exchanger, as well as the combustion chamber, are important components of a central
combustion heating system. These components are located inside the device and are not observed during a nonexhaustive visual inspection, because they require specialized knowledge, the use of specialized instruments and
exhaustive methods. Only a heating specialist can review these components. Note: Some cities and / or fire
departments have regulations specific to their districts. Check with these authorities if notices and / or restrictions
apply to the property's installations.

month. The signal will sound after pressing the test button. It should be replaced every 10 years and it is
recommended to replace the batteries (if applicable) twice a year at time changes. Note that smoke detectors are
designed to detect smoke only. They will not trigger even in the presence of high concentrations of carbon
monoxide. (CAA)
For more than 15 years, it has been mandatory to install carbon monoxide detectors in homes with a combustion
device (eg: fireplace, stove, refrigerator, water heater, etc.) and / or a attached garage. Carbon monoxide is a gas
produced by the combustion of products such as wood, gasoline, fuel oil, natural gas, propane gas, kerosene and
naphtha. Many people are unaware of the dangers of this deadly gas which, unlike smoke, is odorless and does
not irritate the eyes or throat. Carbon monoxide detectors must meet the newly adopted CAN/CSA-6.19 standard,
which is much more severe than the previous standard. A certification to this effect must appear on the packaging
and it must be mentioned that the device will activate if a concentration of 150 particles per million (150 ppm) is
present for 50 minutes. Finally, if you have a backup heating system, it is strongly recommended that you use a
battery-powered alarm in the event of an electrical failure (CAA). It is recommended to replace it every 5 years.
Note: If the detector is located in an electrical outlet, current owners may bring it with them. In this case, be sure
to replace it as soon as you take possession.
LIMITED INSPECTION: The inspector is not required to test smoke or carbon monoxide detectors.
Smoke detector(s):
Present(s)

Carbon monoxide detector(s):
Not applicable, as it is not required

Overview:
Shrinkage and cracks were observed on the ceiling and walls of various rooms. They are part of a normal aging process
and can be removed easily during future decor changes.

Limited inspection
Rooms and/or storage areas cluttered with personal effects, limited inspection. Note: High potential risk of mold growth when
objects and/or furniture are pressed directly against a wall (especially an exterior wall) for an extended period. Keep a
minimum clearance of 1 "between the walls and any objects. Check the condition of the walls covered before the final signing
of the contracts. Since this inspection is visual and not exhaustive, we cannot know if inadequate insulation could damage the
structure. All damaged materials should be removed and replaced.

Not applicable

Observation:
No disorder observed during the inspection

Monitoring recommended
Water infiltration and/or damage repaired by the seller. It would be prudent and diligent in ensuring that corrective work has
been carried out following good practice, and the source was addressed. Since this inspection is visual and non-exhaustive,
we cannot know without opening the wall/ceiling if this water infiltration has caused damage to the wall's elements. All
damaged materials should always be removed and replaced.

Sporadically damaged

Limited inspection
During the inspection, it was observed that the flooring beneath the carpet could not be assessed, as most of the floor was
covered. The condition of the hidden floor remains unknown, and potential issues or defects may exist.

Limited inspection
We observed one or more bumps/drops and flexible floor in places. The concrete slab was not visible. Check underneath the
coating to determine the cause and correct if necessary. In-depth expertise can clarify if you want to know the exact reason. It
will be wise to carry out the expertise before the signature on the final documents.

GENERAL BUILDING STRUCTURE OF THE PRIVATE AREA
Limitation
Limitation: No calculation of the structure of the walls or floors is carried out, only the apparent anomalies are
noted in the report. For such a structural calculation, call on a qualified structural engineer or architect.
The conformity analysis of the installation of structures exceeds the skills of the inspector. Only a qualified
engineer / architect can rule on the conformity of the installation.

Observation
No important defects noticed at time of inspection

Common areas not inspected
The inspection of the interior structure of a condominium is limited to the finishes that enclose the unit. If cracks or weaknesses
in these wall or ceiling panels are observed, they would be noted in the report. No common areas or other private areas
inspected that could help identify a structural problem for the entire building.

RISK FACTORS SPECIFIC TO BUILDINGS
Pyrite / Sulfation / Hydrostatic pressure
Sign(s) of disorder noticed that leads us to suspect the presence of a problematic

Further investigation
NOTE FOR SYNDICATE:
During the inspection, we could observe cracks and / or swelling of the floor, possibility due to pyrite or sulfation or hydrostatic
pressure. A more in-depth expertise needs to be done by an expert to determine the exact cause and the costs of repairing it
before the expiration of the inspection condition of your promise to purchase.

Asbestos
Asbestos:
No signs of disorder noticed that leads us to suspect the presence of a problematic.

Information
Even if no signs lead us to believe the presence of materials that can contain asbestos, based on the year of construction,
some materials could contain asbestos. If you plan to make repairs / renovations, we recommend that you have some
materials checked by a specialist company and that you check with the competent authorities the precautions to be taken as
well as the means to dispose of them safely. If you decide not to perform testing, be sure to properly seal the areas you
renovate to prevent dust from spreading throughout the building and be sure to wear the appropriate personal protective
equipment to avoid potential health problems.

CONTAMINATES
Contaminates
Recommendation / Mold: Molds are microscopic fungi found in the wild and transported to homes by drafts,
humans or pets. Once inside, mold can develop if it is in the presence of sufficient water or moisture and nutrients
such as wood, cardboard or plasterboard (gypsum). They are often found in damp places, for example around the
bathtub or windows.
When they are in small quantities and are removed regularly, mold is generally not a serious problem. On the
other hand, when they grow significantly, the molds disperse breathable particles in the air, which can, in some
cases, lead to health problems.
Health Canada recommends eliminating all forms of mold and quickly resolving significant water and moisture
issues to prevent potential health problems.
Note: Keeping the relative humidity (RH) indoors including basement and crawl space between 30 and 50%
maximum will prevent and / or stop the spread of mold and reduce condensation in the windows. The use of a
dehumidifier combined with heating, air conditioning and ventilation will reduce and control the humidity. To
prevent condensation on windows during the heating season and when the outside temperature is below -10 ° C
(14 ° F), the recommended indoor RH is 30%.

Recommendation
The building is old and it likely may have been affected by some water infiltration or water damage, or heat loss leading to
condensation issues during its existence, which may result in mold formation. Mold can be harmful to health and to some
people in particular. To ensure the absence of mold, only a more thorough expertise such as an air test by a recognized
laboratory could validate the presence or not of pathogenic elements that can affect your health. A humidity level of less than
50% must be maintained in the building at all times to reduce the spread of mold. When encountered, the mold must be
removed or the materials must be replaced by people competent in the matter.

INSECTS AND UNWANTED ANIMALS
Species
No signs of major disorder observed

Information
Nothing to report during the inspection - No insects, animals nor excrement observed during our inspection to make us suspect
a problem.

Limitation / Obligations: IMPORTANT : Never tolerate the presence of insects and/or rodents inside the
dwelling. Consult an exterminator as needed. Pesticide technicians can provide valuable assistance in dealing
with troublesome pests. In Canada, only licensed exterminators can charge a fee for a pesticide application. Ask if
they follow the IPM strategies. They should conduct a thorough inspection of your apartment, monitor the pests
and identify the contributing conditions. Only then would an IPM-trained technician take reasonable and effective
action — called precision targeting — to control and prevent the problem from recurring. (CMHC)
Consult an exterminator if required.

COMMON AREAS WITH SPECIAL ATTENTION
Information / Limitation
IMPORTANT : As stated in the service agreement and our standard of practice, common areas are not part of
our inspection mandate. However, during our inspection, it is sometimes possible to observe certain elements that
may represent significant risks or impacts on your investment or on your condominium unit. It is therefore our
professional responsibility to bring these elements to your attention so that you can check with the Syndicate of coownership whether corrective work has been started or is about to be.
LIMITED INSPECTION: If any items are mentioned below, they are for informational purposes only. They were
observed while entering the building or from your condominium unit and are in no way a reflection of a complete
inspection of the common areas.

Recommendation
During the inspection, it was observed that the downspout is discharging water directly onto the wooden balcony, which
subsequently flows onto the roof membrane of the terrace below. This situation can cause premature deterioration of the
wooden balcony and damage to the roof membrane, leading to potential leaks and costly repairs.
It is recommended to consult with a qualified professional to assess the issue and provide an appropriate solution, such as
redirecting the downspout or installing proper drainage systems to prevent water from accumulating on the balcony and roof
membrane. Buyers should address this concern before finalizing the property purchase to ensure the long-term integrity and
safety of these areas.

To be corrected
Cracks of one millimeter and more observed in the foundation. All cracks are a potential risk of infiltration and may betray other
problems. These types of cracks must be repaired and sealed immediately by a professional to prevent water or insects from
infiltrating. Following water infiltration, the effects of freezing and thawing could accentuate the deterioration and cause
damage to the structure. Consult a contractor specialized in the field who offers a guarantee on the work done. It is always
WISE to do these verifications before the conclusion of the purchase of the building in order to evaluate the content of the work
to be done and to know the associated costs. Since this inspection is visual and non-exhaustive, it is impossible for us to
validate if the current condition has already caused a history of infiltrations and affected the underlying materials. Remove and
replace all damaged materials where required.

To be corrected
During our inspection, we noticed that the retaining walls were unstable, leaning and cracked. Correct any deficiencies
immediately for the safety of all. We strongly recommend seeking a qualified landscape contractor for this type of work. Note
that proper drainage of the retaining walls is highly important to extend its life expectancy.

To be corrected
We found that the mortar joints are damaged in some areas. This binder must be strong and create a waterproof barrier to
resist weather and ensure the integrity of the masonry walls. Water infiltration through these damaged brick joints can affect
the masonry, structure and other components. Its properties are altered, it is imperative to immediately make the necessary
corrections; either ponctual reparation or repointing some sections. Since this inspection is visual and not exhaustive, it is
impossible for us to validate if the current condition has already caused a history of infiltration and affected the underlying
materials. Remove and replace all damaged materials where required.

CONCLUSION
Conclusion

The information in this inspection report is expressed subject to the sometimes limiting assumptions and
conditions of the environment and location. Please note that we do not perform any title checks on the subject
property or potentially related encumbrances. No legal studies, engineer's reports, soil analyses, geological
surveys or toxic waste sampling have been performed in connection with this inspection. Therefore, we assume
no responsibility for these matters, nor for any dismantling or engineering techniques that may be required to
uncover any inherent or hidden defects in the subject property.
The inspection does not constitute a guarantee as to the compliance of the building in question with the various
municipal and/or provincial regulations, fire departments and/or building codes/regulations. We assume no
responsibility for defining what constitutes a partial loss or total loss in the event of a loss. It is recommended that
you obtain all available documents related to the property, such as: certificates of compliance, soil tests, appliance
warranties, maintenance contracts, user manuals, major renovations, etc.
When you purchase your home insurance, the insurer may ask a preventionist to visit the house. Following this
visit, the preventionist may issue findings or recommendations. We have mentioned a few elements (not
exhaustive) that we have noted during the inspection, some of which are included in this report. The preventionist
could therefore require various corrective measures and some of this work could be costly. The insurer could ask
you for a certificate of compliance for various points (which is currently not our mandate), or to make changes and
provide an invoice from a recognized contractor upon request to confirm that the corrective work was carried out
according to the rules of the trade. We would like to remind you that some of the deficiencies raised in this report
could be the subject of a correction request by your insurer.
This inspection is intended to detect important visual signs of disorder that could compromise the integrity of the
building, but not aesthetic defects or poor finish. They may have been discussed during the inspection, but are not
included in this report.

Useful life of the building's components: Our inspection mandate does not include the assessment of the
useful life of building components and systems. However, in order to help you plan a replacement schedule and
the associated budget to allocate, a document published by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation

Information
When shopping for home insurance, the insurer could ask an evaluator to visit the house. The evaluator could announce
observations or recommendations. We have mentioned few elements (not exhaustive) that we noted during the inspection; in
the current report.
The insurer could therefore require various corrective measures and realization of some of these works could be expensive. At
the same time, the insurer could ask you for a certificate of compliance for multiple elements (not included in the current
mandate) or to make modifications and provide, on request, an invoice from an accredited contractor to confirm that the
corrective measures have been executed according to the industry standards. Therefore, be prepared that some of the
deficiencies stated in this report could be the subject of a request for correction by your insurer.

REPORT LIMITATIONS
Limitations of the inspection and report
General
This report is based on a visual inspection of major items visible. The hidden structure, wiring, piping, evacuation routes in groundwater and
drainage, etc.. cannot be inspected. The recovery of the chimney, the air exchanger of the furnace, the oil tank and jacuzzi cannot be
inspected. Our inspections meet or exceed the standards and practices established by the Canadian Association of Residential Property
Inspections.
Our inspection and report do not and are not intended to cover the presence of UFFI (Formaldehyde), insects infestation, appliances, alarm
systems, pools, tennis court, WELLS, SEPTIC TANKS, Central vacuum system, trees and playground equipment. We do not unsettle
equipments, walls, floors, ceilings, do not move the furniture, boxes, do not remove carpets, insulation materials, or do not open the wall
coverings. Should a dispute or an error on the inspection report occur, you consent (if necessary) to allow us to re-inspect and / or evaluate
the problem before the repairs are made, otherwise we will not be held responsible.
Our report is not exhaustive in nature and does not imply that every component was inspected or that defects may have been discovered. For
example, when the property contains several articles of similar nature (such as windows and electrical outlets), a representative sample of
each has been inspected. A slight inclination of the floors are considered normal as long as the structure is supported accordingly.

Inspection during the winter
When there is presence of ice or snow, the surface of the roof, flashing, chimney, roof drainage, foundations, leveling surface, or ancillary
structures, may be difficult nor impossible to inspect. Observations may be incomplete depending on conditions existing at the time of the
inspection.
The incomplete items on your report may require monitoring in the spring. As this requires a second visit, and therefore additional charge, the
work would only be done upon a specific request on your behalf.

Additional Work
Our fees are based on a single visit to the property. If additional visits are needed for one reason or another, additional fees will be charged.
The estimated costs, if given, are budgetary only, and we strongly recommend that you obtain written estimates from contractors before
starting any project. Our hourly rate for court appearances as expert witness is 150.00$, payable in advance.

Agreement
I understand and agree that this is a limited inspection and based on a reasonable inspection time duration and whose purpose is to cover the
main components of the house, that we are not an expert in each field, and that an exhaustive inspection has not been made.
If there is a difference between verbal and the written report, the written report shall prevail. This report does not guarantee that the building
meets the zoning laws, municipal or provincial building codes. You should also budget 3% of the price paid for the house for any needed
repairs that may have not be noted during the inspection.
I have read and understood the exclusions and the limitations of the inspection and the report. I understand that any inspection or report made
by 9406-7196 Quebec Inc. does not contain implicit or explicit guarantee.
Pictures were taken by the inspector as an individual need to fill in the report and will be kept on file. A copy may be handed to you further to a
written request from you.
